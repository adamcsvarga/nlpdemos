# Online NLP Demos
## Created by Adam Varga, 2013-15

Three simple online demos demonstrating basic NLP concepts and applications. They require Javascript and PHP.

1. `eliza.html`
   This program is a loose recreation of the first computer chatbot called Eliza, designed by Roger Weizenbaum in the 1960s. It simulates a psychotherapist. Some of the topics it likes to talk about are family, pets, fears and love life. It is very unlikely to have a meaningful conversation with it.
2. `anagram.php`
   This is a very simple tool for finding the possible anagrams of English words (i. e. the permutations of the letters of the given word that are valid words themselves). Due to computational limitations the input field is limited to 6 characters.
3. `editdistance.php`
   This program calculates the minimum edit distance (also called the Levenshtein distance) between two words. The insertion, deletion and substitution costs are tuneable parameters.
